# Python-Data-Analysis---Retail

This task was assigned by The Sparks Foundation. While I was appointed as Data Science & Business Analyst, i workd on this task for 4 days and achieved multiple conclusions depending on what criteria the data was on. The task was to explore the data and use various other libraries to improve data visualisation. 

The Task --> Exploratory Data Analysis - Retail. 

Problem --> As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit. What all business problems you can derive by exploring the data?

Before going through the .ipynb file  and start analyzing on what the project is, i would recommend one to use these libraries across IDE's which will enhance the way of presentation, those are mentioned below

1.) Seaborn:- This basically generates plots for visualisation, whitout seaborn data visualisation isn't possible.

2.) Matplotlib:- This is another library which is used for plots, namely calculative plots.

3.) Pandas:- Pandas is used for accessing csv and xlsx files, which is used for further visualisation.

4.) Numpy:- Used for calculative purposes.

5.) Ignore Warnings:- This basically ignores warniings gievn by the IDE.
